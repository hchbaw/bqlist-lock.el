;;; Commentary:
;;
;; On Vim, backquoted parentheses are colored distinctly different from
;; normal parentheses by default lisp syntax highlighting. I want its effect
;; on Emacs, too.

;; Please load this file then execute `bqlist-lock-enable' once for each
;; buffer for example:
;;
;;   (require 'bqlist-lock)
;;   (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'bqlist-lock-enable)
